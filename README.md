# Panatilihin

Panatilihin is a feature-rich note-taking application inspired by Google Keep. As a beginner/junior level Android developer, this project showcases my skills and serves as a portfolio piece for my job hunting. I aim to demonstrate my commitment to following best practices in software development and architecture. With a clean and intuitive user interface, this app allows users to create, edit, and manage their notes seamlessly.
