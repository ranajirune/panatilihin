# Panatilihin

Panatilihin is a feature-rich note-taking application inspired by Google Keep. I created this project to highlight my expertise in mobile development and my ability to implement industry-standard practices. I aim to demonstrate my commitment to following best practices in software development and architecture. With a clean and intuitive user interface, this app allows users to create, edit, and manage their notes seamlessly.

# Features
